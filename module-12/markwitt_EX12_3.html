The Legion promotes interest in STAR WARS and facilitates the use of these costumes for STAR WARS-related events as well as contributes to the local community through costumed charity and volunteer work.

                                    In 2010 I began working at a Burger King franchise, working my way up the ladder from team member all the way up to General Manager in 2020.
